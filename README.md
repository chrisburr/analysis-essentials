# LHCb analysis essentials [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/analysis-essentials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/analysis-essentials)

These are the common Starterkit lessons that are designed to be applicable to
all high energy physicists, regardless of which experiment they work on. If you
want more information on the software used in your experiment see:

  - [LHCb Starterkit lessons](https://lhcb.github.io/starterkit-lessons/)
  - [ALICE software tutorials]()

The material on this page is meant to be complementary to the excellent
[Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) that
we will also be using for the actual course. Here, we simply supply extra stuff
that we deem important for working in HEP.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [send an email to
`lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch`](mailto:lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch).
