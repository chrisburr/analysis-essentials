# Git
As stated on the project's official website [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com),

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
efficiency.

Great so this means that here we have a tool that we can use free of charge
(even better, we can look at and modify the source code) which allows us to
version our projects. Versioning in turn means that we can keep a history of
changes made to the project in question. Additionally it is distributed which
for practical purposes means that me keeping a history does not depend on the
benevolence (or even existence) of some remote server. The following tutorial is
intended to

 1. Convince you of Git's superiority
 2. Teach you to use Git locally to version changes on a local project
 3. Teach you to use Git to collaborate with others on remote projects

We hope that at the end of the day (or at least after the first time Git has
saved you from losing your progress) you will accept that it is _the best and
only way_ to version anything from your diary to your future company's software.
